        <h1 id="remote-build-execution---an-overview">Remote Build Execution - An Overview</h1>
<p>One of the big benefits of using build systems like Bazel is that it supports remote-execution and caching of the build out of the box. Each action in the build graph can be executed on a remote machine, cached and then downloaded onto the local machine. When there are multiple developers on the team (or you are re-building your project from scratch on a different machine), and if the build has already been run by a developer in the team, then the other developers can simply reuse the results of the previous build thereby reducing the build time and load on the their local machines.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-a-remotely-executed-build-faster">How is a remotely executed build faster?</h2>
<p>Faster end-to-end build time is achieved in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>High Parallelism</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>In a locally executed build, the build parallelism is usually capped to the number of CPU cores / RAM available on the machine (for example <code>-j 16</code> of <code>-j 96</code> if you are on one of those more expensive machines). With a remotely executed build you can far exceed the local parallelism and can go upto <code>-j 500</code> or even <code>-j 1000</code> depending on how good and light-weight the client implementation is. If portions of the build graph are wider than the <code>-j</code> value of the local machine, then those portions will heavily benefit by high parallelism.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><em><strong>Cached Action Results</strong></em></li>
</ol>
<p>While remote-execution of an individual action is generally expected to be slower than a locally executed action (remote-execution has overhead like shipping local input files to remote server, running the action on remote-server and downloading remotely executed results), fetching the cached result of a previously remotely executed action is usually faster than locally executing a build action. In a large organization (like Google :D) or a large repository, <a href="http://google-engtools.blogspot.com/2011/09/build-in-cloud-distributing-build-steps.html"><code>&gt; 90%</code></a> of the overall actions generally result in cache-hits. The larger the number of repetitive builds you do, the higher your cache-hit rate will be.</p>
<h2 id="remote-execution-api">Remote Execution API</h2>
<h3 id="action-specification">Action Specification</h3>
<p>Build systems like Bazel use the open source <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis">Remote Execution API</a> with a corresponding gRPC server that implements a remote-execution API. The remote-execution API describes a mechanism for executing an arbitrary local command remotely. In order to execute a command on a remote machine you would need the following basic things:</p>
<ol>
<li>The command line invocation</li>
<li>Input files / directories</li>
<li>Environment variables</li>
<li>Output files / directories</li>
<li>Platform configuration (like Mac / Linux / Windows)</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, lets say you want to run a compilation action like the following on a remote Linux machine</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">PWD=/proc/self/cwd clang++ -c test.cpp -o test.o
</code></pre></div><p>Here&rsquo;s what the various requirements mentioned above would map to:</p>
<ol>
<li>The command line invocation = <code>clang++ -c test.cpp -o test.o</code>.</li>
<li>Input files / directories
This would include the following files:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">1. test.cpp
2. test.h
3. ... other header files included by test.h / test.cpp transitively ...
</code></pre></div><ol start="3">
<li>Environment variables = <code>PWD=/proc/self/cwd</code></li>
<li>Output files / directories = <code>test.o</code></li>
<li>Platform configuration = <code>OS=Linux, toolchain=clang-10</code>
Note that the platform configuration you specify depends on what platform configurations the remote-execution server respects. In the example above, the remote-execution server would have to know to make <code>clang-10</code> binaries available during command execution and must execute the command on a Linux machine. As you can imagine, more fancier platform specifications are possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>An encapsulation of the various things described above is what we call an <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/master/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto#L388"><code>Action</code></a>. An <code>Action</code> captures the various information needed to run the command on a remote server.</p>
<h3 id="content-addressable-storage">Content Addressable Storage</h3>
<p>We looked at what goes into an action but haven&rsquo;t described how the action is presented to the remote-execution server by the client. In the remote-execution API specification, content-addressable storage (CAS) is used to present the action and also the dependencies specified by the action. The CAS is a common key-value store that both the remote-execution client and remote-execution server utilize for exchanging data.
The general series of steps in presenting an a piece of data (an action spec / an input file etc) to a remote-execution server using content-addressable storage is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Compute the digest of the what you want to store.</p>
<p>a. In the case of a regular file, it will be a digest of the file.</p>
<p>b. In the case of a directory, it will be a digest of the Merkle tree root of the directory.</p>
<p>c. In the case of an action specification, it will be a digest of the wire format of the action spec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the digest along with the data in CAS. The digest will be the key and the data itself will be the value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Present the digest to the remote-execution server which can in-turn utilize the CAS service to fetch the data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="steps-involved-in-running-an-action">Steps involved in running an action</h3>
<p>At this point we have all the basic building blocks we need to see how we can run an action remotely. Lets take a sample C++ compile command we saw above, add more details to it and see how it can be remotely executed with the remote-execution API.</p>
<p>test.cpp:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">#include &#34;test.h&#34;
int main() {
    std::cout &lt;&lt; &#34;Hello world!\n&#34;;
    return 0;
}
</code></pre></div><p>test.h</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">#ifndef TEST_H
#define TEST_H

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

#endif
</code></pre></div><ol>
<li>Determine the inputs of above action. In Bazel, the dependent header files are described in <code>BUILD</code> file. In scenarios where that is not the case, the test.cpp file will be preprocessed to find out the dependent header files.</li>
<li>Upload each of the header files along to CAS keyed with their digest.</li>
<li>Determine the output to be produced by the action. In this case, the output is going to be <code>test.o</code> file.</li>
<li>Determine the toolchain to be used for this compilation. Lets assume that we are going to use <code>clang-10</code> and assume that the remote-execution server will make it available when remotely running the action.</li>
<li>Construct the action spec. It would look something like (in textproto):</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">input_root_digest: &lt;input-dir-digest&gt;
output_files: &#34;test.o&#34;
platform: {
    key: &#34;toolchain&#34;
    value: &#34;clang-10&#34;
}
platform: {
    key: &#34;OS&#34;
    value: &#34;Linux&#34;
}
</code></pre></div><ol start="6">
<li>Serialize the action spec to binary format and compute the digest of the serialized action spec.</li>
<li>Upload the action spec to CAS keyed by its digest.</li>
<li>Call <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/master/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto#L107">Execute()</a> RPC on the remote-execution server.</li>
<li>Download the output file from the CAS using the digest present in the result of the <code>Execute()</code> call.</li>
</ol>
